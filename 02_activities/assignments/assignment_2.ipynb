    "\n",
    "2. **Edge Case Handling**:\n",
    "   - Scenarios like an empty input list (`[]`) or a tree with only `None` values (`[None]`) should be explicitly tested and handled to avoid unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Formatting**:\n",

    "Working through Assignment 1 posed unique challenges, particularly in tackling a problem that required a deep understanding of binary tree structures and traversal algorithms. My assigned task involved identifying duplicate values in a binary tree, while my partner’s task focused on finding all root-to-leaf paths in a tree. Despite the difference in our questions, the underlying data structure was the same, which helped me draw parallels between our solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing my partner’s work was both insightful and challenging. Their problem required constructing a binary tree from a list and then implementing depth-first search (DFS) to find paths, which differed significantly from my breadth-first search (BFS)-based solution for detecting duplicates. Breaking down their code to understand its logic and efficiency allowed me to see how they approached recursion and backtracking, two concepts I found less intuitive. I created additional test cases to validate their solution and found their implementation robust, though I suggested improvements for handling edge cases and invalid inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining their solution in my own words and critiquing it constructively pushed me to engage deeply with their logic. This process not only enhanced my understanding of binary tree traversal but also helped me appreciate the value of diverse problem-solving approaches. The assignment emphasized the importance of clear communication, peer learning, and analytical thinking, all of which are crucial for technical interviews.\n"
